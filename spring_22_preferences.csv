I also appreciate y'all for being so communicative and keeping us in the loop! 

P.S. I'm sure this is probably noted somewhere, but I was at Kaiser Downey during the summer semester and for onboarding, if it is possible, it would be less stressful to start the process ASAP since there were a number of modules we had to do (and we sadly were informed about them with less than a week before the deadline). However, I am aware that this will be up to the instructor so just wanted to put it out there 🥰"
